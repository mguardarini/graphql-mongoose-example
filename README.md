### Link to [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) documentation

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

## Getting Started

Using a node.js server? Just use express-graphql! It can automatically present GraphiQL, if you using another GraphQL service? GraphiQL is relatively easy to set up. With npm:

##### Install the packages:

This example uses GraphQL, Mongoose and JWT.

You can install the packages in two ways:

```
npm install
```
If you have errors, please install package by package it's not a lot, right? :satisfied:

```
$ npm install --save express-graphql
```
```
$ npm install jsonwebtoken

```
```
$ npm install mongoose -save
```
